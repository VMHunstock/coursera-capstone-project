#The project details can be found at the following GitHub location: https://github.com/VMHunstock/coursera-capstone-project.git
#This project establishes city locations to avoid while driving during unfavourable weather conditinos like rain, ice etc., based on historical accident severity in these locations. The targt audience are city planners and road infratructure planners, policemem and traffic wardens, as well as emergency medical personnel. 
#We will choose a boxplot to show accident severity in different spots of the city at different road conditions (snow, rain, ice etc). 

#The data used to solve the problem was traffic data in a csv-format, available from https://s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DP0701EN/version-2/Data-Collisions.csv and the metadata at https://s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DP0701EN/version-2/Metadata.pdf.

#Results 
#This section discusses the results.
#The resuts provide a direction in terms of which city locations to avoid while driving during unfavourable weather conditinos like rain, ice etc., based on historical accident severity in these locations. The reslts might be useful for city planners and road infratructure planners, policemem and traffic wardens, as well as emergency medical personnel.
