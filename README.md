This project establishes city locations to avoid while driving during unfavourable weather conditinos like rain, ice etc., based on historical accident severity in these locations. The targt audience are city planners and road infratructure planners, policemem and traffic wardens, as well as emergency medical personnel. 
The project details can be found at the following GitHub location: https://github.com/VMHunstock/coursera-capstone-project.git
We will choose a boxplot to show accident severity in different spots of the city at different road conditions (snow, rain, ice etc). 

The supporting materials for the code presented as a Jupyter Notebook comprise a PowerPoint presentation and a Report.
